<p> <span class="character1">Neuvillette</span> is an upcoming playable <span class="character1">Hydro</span> character in Genshin Impact.

Neuvillette is the Iudex of Fontaine, and the leader of the Marechaussee Phantom. While Neuvillette upholds the rules of
the court with utmost reverence and frequently keeps Furina's flamboyancy in check, he is quite aloof when dealing with
human emotions and often distances himself from the public eye.</p>
